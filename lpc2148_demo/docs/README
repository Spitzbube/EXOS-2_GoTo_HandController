OK, so I haven't quite gotten to drawing the schematics...  So here's the pin
list.

-------------------- ENC28J60 -------------------- 

I used a in28J60 module from www.modtronix.com.  In retrospect, I should have
used the Olimex module, as it doesn't have these annoying press fit pins.  As I
mentioned in the top-level README, the in28J60 module was $5 cheaper, and I
thought the press fit pins might be useful.  

I ended up de-soldering them and putting pins in similiar to those used on the
LPC-P2148 board. On the board, I used some female header pins, so I could
replace the in28J60 module.  This was a good decision, because either the first
module was bad, or I damaged it.

Module              LPC-P2148
------------------------------------------------
Pin X1-1 (GND)      GND on SPI0 pin set
Pin X1-2 (CS#)      SSEL0 on SPI0 pin set
Pin X1-3 (CLKOUT)   Not connected
Pin X1-4 (RST#)     P0.22 near AN_TR
Pin X1-5 (INT#)     RS1/UEXT pin 3 (nearest UEXT)

Pin X2-1 (Vaux)     Not connected
Pin X2-2 (Vin)      3.3V on SPI0 pin set
Pin X2-3 (SCK)      SCK0 on SPIO pin set
Pin X2-4 (SDO)      MISO on SPI0 pin set
Pin X2-5 (SDI)      MOSI on SPI0 pin set


----------------------  LCD ---------------------- 

I had some CrystalFontz CFAH1602Z-YYH-ET displays left over from a previous
project.  I made up a small cable that plugged into the LCD and had a 12 pin
Molex connector on the other end.  The Molex connector plugs straight on to the
connector next to the SD/MMC card connector, and provides all the signals
except for the negative bias.  

The bias can be provided through an external supply, or the charge pump circuit
in the 'biaspump.png' diagram can be built and connected to the output of PWM5
(P0.25).  The CFAH1602Z-YYH-ET display requires about -1.5V to be really
readable.

In theory, a AA battery with the POSITIVE terminal connected to GND on the LCD
and the NEGATIVE terminal connected to V0 should OK contrast.  A proper
adjustable circuit would, of course, be better.

There are some additional notes in the lcd/README file that may be worth
looking at.
